The goal of this project is to be able to predict what rating a customer would give to a product. This enables businesses to better understand what customers think of their products as social media platforms such a Twitter and Youtube do not have rating systems.

This web application can search through Twitter and extract tweets which relate to a given keyword and classify the tweets into 5 categories. These categories represent ratings (out of 5) where 1 is bad and 5 is excellent. Ideally, the keywords should be products but, the webpage can also take in just about anything so long as people are talking about it on Twitter.  

This web application utilizes a neural network and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) to make the classifications of the tweets. The machine learning models are based on the Is Bigger Better? Text Classification using state-of-the-art BERT with limited Compute research paper by: Ayaz Nakhuda, David Ferris and Jastejpal Soora.
